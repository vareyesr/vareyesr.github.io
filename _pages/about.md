Hello! My name is Victor Reyes, PhD in Computer Science from Chile.

My Research interests are currently:

* Numerical constraint satisfaction/optimization problems
* Interval Branch & Bound solvers.
* Trust regions for constrained nonlinear optimization
* Numerical methods
* Dynamical systems under intervals

The advisor of my PhD thesis "Improving the efficiency of Interval Branch & Bound Solvers" was Ignacio Araya.
